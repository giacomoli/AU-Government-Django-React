As at 21/7/2015, I'm still waiting to find out whether the Registrar of Probates accepts the court documents that Armstrong Legal want to file in the Supreme Court (for an Inheritance Act claim). (We submitted them for inspection last week.)

A couple of things to note: 
1. The cheque that was sent to us by Armstrong Legal to pay filing fees, was for the amount of the pre-30 June filing fee. The Court has that cheque, and is supposed to call us to pay the balance by credit card when the documents are approved and accepted for filing. Remember to charge the balance that we pay by credit card as a disbursement to the client. Ask the registry to send a receipt and prepare an accounting notification. 
2. Copies of the court documents were also submitted for inspection, but only the original documents were retained for inspection. If the documents are approved, the Court will call us to require that the copies be walked down to the SC registry and filed. ",Mary-Anne Sotiropoulos,21/07/2015
